# 2000

C# introduced

# 2005

C# 2.0 introduced (generics)

F# introduced
  (full type inference, Seq module (essentially LINQ-to-objects))
  pattern matching, DUs, tuples, records, local funcs

# 2007

C# 3.0 introduced (var keyword, LINQ)

# 2010

C# 4.0 introduced (covariance and contravariance, named arguments, dynamic keyword)

F# 2.0 introduced (async blocks (cexprs), active patterns, units of measure, quotations)

# 2012

C# 5.0 introduced (async methods)

F# 3.0 introduced (type providers, LINQ query expressions (like C# syntax sugar))

# 2015

C# 6.0 introduced (expression-bodied members, null propagating ?., string interpolation)

F# 4.0 introduced (ctors as functions, type provider enhancements (non-null, static method parameters))

# 2017

C# 7.0 planned
    Pattern matching (not exhaustive)
    Tuples
    Binary literals
    Generalized async return type
      (can use like computation expressions, stateful implementation is harder to understand but potentially faster)
    Throw becomes an expression
    Expression-bodied members for getters/setters/constructors/finalizers
    ...Ref locals and returns
